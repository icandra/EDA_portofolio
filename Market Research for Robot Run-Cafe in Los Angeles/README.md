## Project Description

In this project, I will help my partners prepare some
market research. We decide to open a small robot-run cafe in Los Angeles. The project is
promising but expensive, so we will try to attract
investors. 

By examining the open-source data on restaurants in Los Angeles-CAL, USA, we want to provide the investors with the current information on market conditions.

## Objective
Generating market research analysis about the current restaurant condition in LA. Here are several points to highlight:
1. Restaurant stablishments' profile in LA
2. Typical establishment that can survive in LA
3. Get an insight into the kind of establishment best suited to the robot-run cafe, the possibility of developing a chain, and the ability to maintain its success when the novelty of robot waiters wears off
