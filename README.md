In this project, I assisted my partners in preparing market research to open a small robot-run cafe in Los Angeles. Given the project's potential and cost, we aimed to attract investors by providing them with current market conditions based on open-source data about restaurants in Los Angeles, California, USA. The objectives were to generate a comprehensive analysis of the current restaurant landscape in LA, identify profiles of successful establishments, gain insights into the ideal type of establishment for the robot-run cafe, explore possibilities of expansion as a chain, and ensure sustained success even after the novelty of robot waiters wears off. The research aimed to present valuable information to potential investors and support decision-making for the cafe venture.<br>

## Project January, 2023 | [Analyzing Taxi Rides in Chicago: Unearthing Insights from Competitor Databases and Weather Data](https://github.com/icandra/EDA_portofolio/tree/main/Chicago%20Ride-Sharing%20Trends%20Passenger%20Preferences%20and%20Weather%20Impact)

In 2017, Zuber, a new ride-sharing company, launched its services in Chicago. Leveraging the information available at that time, our analysis aimed to discover patterns in passenger preferences and assess the influence of external factors on ride trends. To achieve this, we examined taxi ride data from competitors to uncover patterns in Chicago, IL-USA, and integrated weather data scraped from internet sources. The analysis covered the month of November 2017 and focused on three key points: identifying the number of trips from different taxi companies, pinpointing common drop-off locations, and testing a hypothesis regarding the correlation between weather conditions and ride frequency. With these insights, we aimed to gain a deeper understanding of ride-sharing dynamics to inform Zuber's strategies and decision-making.

## Project December, 2022 | [Uncovering the Key Patterns for Successful Advertising Planning in Games](https://github.com/icandra/EDA_portofolio/tree/main/Analysis%20Pattern%20for%20Successful%20Game%20Ads)

This analysis will identify patterns determining the successful game based on several indicators. We will spot potential big winners for the next advertising campaign planning. This analysis will use genre, platform, rating, and game sales indicators.<br>There is no information about the quality of the data. Thus, we will evaluate the quality of the data and see whether its issues are significant. By conducting data preprocessing, we will account for the most critical problems. After that, we can test the hypotheses through a statistical test.

## Project December, 2022 | [Unraveling Megaline's Telecom Services: Unlocking the Best Service Plan](https://github.com/icandra/EDA_portofolio/tree/main/Best%20Service%20Plan%20for%20Telecom%20Operator%20Megaline)

During the project, we collaborated with the telecom operator, Megaline, to analyze the revenue generated by their two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. The commercial department sought insights to optimize its advertising budget effectively. The analysis used data from 500 Megaline clients, encompassing information about their demographics, plan usage, and communication activity (calls and text messages) throughout 2018. The project involved data preprocessing, transformation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical hypotheses testing. By comparing both plans' revenue and excess charges and examining revenue from specific areas, such as New York and New Jersey neighborhoods, we aimed to identify which prepaid plan brought in more revenue for Megaline.
