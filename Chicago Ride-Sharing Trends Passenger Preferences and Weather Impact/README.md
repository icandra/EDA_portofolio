## Project Description
In 2017, Zuber was a new ride-sharing company that launched in Chicago. By relying on the availability of information at that time, we will try to find patterns to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides.<br>

Hence, we will refer to the database from the competitors to identify the taxi rides pattern in Chicago, IL-USA. Besides, we had already scrapped weather data from the internet website. In this analysis, we managed to get data covering the month of November 2017.<br>

This analysis will answer three points:
1. Identify the number of trips from various taxi companies
2. Identify common drop-off locations
3. Test a hypothesis about the impact of weather on ride frequency

Let's get started!
