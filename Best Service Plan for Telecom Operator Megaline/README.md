## Project Description
The telecom operator Megaline company offers two prepaid plans for its clients, Surf and Ultimate. The commercial department wants to know which plans bring more revenue to adjust the advertising budget.

In this notebook, we conducted a preliminary plan analysis based on a relatively small client selection. We had the data on 500 Megaline clients: who the clients are, where they're from, which plan they use, and the number of calls they made and text messages that the users sent in 2018. 

## Objective
This analysis aims to analyze the clients' behaviour and determine which prepaid plan brings in more revenue. 

Here are several steps which are conducted through the analysis:
- Data Preprocessing: Preparing and enriching the dataset
- Data Transformation: Aggregating dataset from several relevant data
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the users' behaviour based on plan types
- Statistical Hypotheses Test: Comparing both plans' average revenue and excess charge. In addition, we compared the revenue from a particular area, New York and New Jersey neighbourhood
